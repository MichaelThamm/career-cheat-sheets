Using Git:

1) open cmd.exe with administrator priviliges
2) cd to correct directory where you want to allow version control
	Note: '<drive letter>:' to change drives
3) Throw the .gitignore file in the root of the git init folder found
	Note: good gitignore repo - https://github.com/github/gitignore
	
To Git clone with token code:
git clone https://<username>:<githubtoken>@github.com/<username>/<repositoryname>.git
Set remote:
git remote set-url origin https://<githubtoken>@github.com/<username>/<repositoryname>.git

___EXAMPLES___

# Compare local to remote branches
git fetch					- This will fetch all of the remote branches
git diff <local> <remote>/<branch>		- git diff main origin/main


# Branch from another branch, and commit
git checkout -b myFeature dev			- Creates MyFeature branch off dev. Do your work and then
git commit -am "<Your message>"			- Now merge your changes to dev without a fast-forward
git checkout dev				- Now merge without fast-forward since we want to keep the original branch as HEAD
git merge --no-ff myFeature			- Now push changes to the server
git push origin dev
git push origin myFeature


# Finished with a remote branch
git push origin --delete <name>			- Delete the remote branch
git fetch origin -p				- Update your local repository references to "prune" the obsolete remote-tracking branch:
